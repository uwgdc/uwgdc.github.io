# Welcome to UW Gamedev!

In case you're new here, we're a student-led game development group at the University of Waterloo. We don't gate membership, so you're already part of the club! Congrats! 🎉

On this site, we publish gamedev resources, guides, and presentations from members and guest speakers alike. Elsewhere, we provide communal spaces for our members.

## Goals and Values

* Guiding game developers at every stage
* Remaining engine-agnostic *(despite our Godot workshops)*
* Welcoming everyone capable of politeness

## Events

All events are hosted both in-person at the University of Waterloo, and through our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tHEXh9d). To hear about new events, you should join it!

### General Meetings *— Thursdays @ 5-7 PM*

Home to most of our presentations and attendees, our Thursday meetings are our most popular offering.

### Game Potlucks — *Saturdays @ 12-2 PM*

Our laid-back potlucks are not for eating food, but for playing games! *Though bringing food is much appreciated.*

### Game Jams — *One Per Term*

Every term, we host a game jam for our members and guests alike. Fun fact: we host the largest student-led jams in Canada.
